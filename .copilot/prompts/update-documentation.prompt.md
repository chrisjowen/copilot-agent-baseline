# Documentation Update Prompt

## Objective
Maintain comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date documentation throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring all changes are properly documented as they are implemented.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Living Documentation
- Documentation should evolve with the code
- Updates happen during development, not after
- Documentation is part of the Definition of Done
- Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation

### Documentation-Driven Development
- Update documentation to reflect intended changes first
- Use documentation to clarify requirements
- Documentation serves as specification for implementation
- Keep documentation concise but complete

## Documentation Types and Locations

## Documentation Update Process

### During Task Implementation

#### Step 1: Identify Documentation Impact
Before coding, identify what documentation needs updating:
- [ ] Will this change system architecture?
- [ ] Does this add/modify user-facing features?
- [ ] Are there new API endpoints or changes?
- [ ] Do setup or deployment instructions change?

#### Step 2: Update Documentation First (When Appropriate)
For some changes, update documentation first as specification:
- [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Feature documentation for new user workflows
- [ ] Architecture diagrams for structural changes

#### Step 3: Update Documentation During Implementation
As you implement:
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update API documentation as endpoints are created
- [ ] Create or update architectural decision records

#### Step 4: Finalize Documentation
Before marking task complete:
- [ ] Review all affected documentation
- [ ] Ensure accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Check links and references
- [ ] Verify examples and code snippets work

### Documentation Quality Checklist

#### Accuracy
- [ ] Information matches current implementation
- [ ] Code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Screenshots are current (if used)
- [ ] Links are valid and working

#### Completeness
- [ ] All public APIs documented
- [ ] User workflows covered
- [ ] Error conditions explained
- [ ] Configuration options listed

#### Clarity
- [ ] Written for target audience
- [ ] Uses clear, concise language
- [ ] Includes examples where helpful
- [ ] Follows consistent formatting

#### Maintainability
- [ ] Easy to find and update
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] Uses automation where possible
- [ ] Version controlled with code

## Specific Update Scenarios

### Adding New API Endpoint
1. **Before Implementation**:
   - [ ] Document endpoint specification in `docs/api/`
   - [ ] Include expected parameters and responses
   - [ ] Note authentication requirements

2. **During Implementation**:
   - [ ] Update code with appropriate docstrings
   - [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic

3. **After Implementation**:
   - [ ] Test and verify documentation examples
   - [ ] Update API changelog if applicable

### Modifying System Architecture
1. **Before Changes**:
   - [ ] Update architecture diagrams
   - [ ] Create ADR for significant decisions

2. **During Implementation**:
   - [ ] Update component descriptions
   - [ ] Modify data flow diagrams if needed

3. **After Implementation**:
   - [ ] Verify diagrams match implementation
   - [ ] Update deployment documentation if needed

### Adding New Feature
1. **Planning Phase**:
   - [ ] Create feature documentation outline
   - [ ] Document user stories and acceptance criteria

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - [ ] Update feature documentation with each task
   - [ ] Add API documentation for new endpoints
   - [ ] Update relevant architecture docs

3. **Completion Phase**:
   - [ ] Review and finalize feature documentation
   - [ ] Update main README if setup changes
   - [ ] Create user-facing documentation if needed

## Documentation Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams
- **API Docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- **Screenshots**: Automated screenshot tools for UI documentation
- **Validation**: Link checkers and documentation linters

### Automation Opportunities
- Generate API docs from code annotations
- Validate documentation in CI/CD pipeline
- Auto-update version numbers and dates
- Check for broken links regularly

## Instructions for Copilot

1. **Document as you go**: Don't defer documentation updates
2. **Be specific**: Include exact steps, parameters, and examples
3. **Keep it current**: Remove outdated information promptly
4. **Think about users**: Write for people who don't know the code
5. **Use examples**: Show don't just tell
6. **Maintain consistency**: Follow existing patterns and formats
7. **Version important changes**: Track significant modifications

### Documentation Update Checklist for Each Task
- [ ] Identified documentation impact before coding
- [ ] Updated relevant documentation during implementation
- [ ] Verified documentation accuracy after implementation
- [ ] Checked that examples and code snippets work
- [ ] Ensured documentation follows project conventions
- [ ] Committed documentation updates with code changes

Remember: Good documentation is an investment in the future maintainability and success of the project. It reduces onboarding time, prevents mistakes, and enables better collaboration.
